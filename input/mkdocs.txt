## Introduction

Crawl4AI has one clear task: to make crawling and data extraction from web pages easy and efficient, especially for large language models (LLMs) and AI applications. Whether you are using it as a REST API or a Python library, Crawl4AI offers a robust and flexible solution.

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to show you how easy it is to use Crawl4AI:
    
    
    from crawl4ai import WebCrawler
    
    # Create an instance of WebCrawler
    crawler = WebCrawler()
    
    # Warm up the crawler (load necessary models)
    crawler.warmup()
    
    # Run the crawler on a URL
    result = crawler.run(url="https://www.nbcnews.com/business")
    
    # Print the extracted content
    print(result.extracted_content)
    

### Explanation

  1. Importing the Library: We start by importing the `WebCrawler` class from the `crawl4ai` library.
  2. Creating an Instance: An instance of `WebCrawler` is created.
  3. Warming Up: The `warmup()` method prepares the crawler by loading necessary models and settings.
  4. Running the Crawler: The `run()` method is used to crawl the specified URL and extract meaningful content.
